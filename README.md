# JupyterPhysics
Reposotory of Jupyter notebooks related to physics calcualtions. 

This reposotory is being modified to a kind of Jupyter Play-ground for Physics. 
The original files are transfered to the jupyter physics organisation: [SystemsSignalsModels](https://github.com/jupyterphysics/SystemsSignalsModels).
*Text below is obsolete and has to be modified soon*
## Introduction
The intention is to build a reposotory on *Models & Signals*, based on a course that is given at te University of Twente. 
This is a growing reposotory of jupyter notebooks as an illustration to work with Python language, with libraries from numpy, scipy and matplotlib as tools to master the field. 
## Content
* Models:
  * Transfer function models
  * Zero-Pole_Gain models
  * State-space models
* Analysis:
  * Bode-plots
  * Nyquist-plots
* Output responses:
  * Step-response
  * Impulse-response
  * Harmonic-response
  * Arbitrary input response
