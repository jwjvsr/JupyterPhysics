# JupyterPhysics
Reposotory of Jupyter notbooks on "Models and Signals".
## Introduction
The intention is to build a reposotory on *Models & Signals*, based on a course that is given at te University of Twente. 
This is a growing reposotory of jupyter notebooks as an illustration to work with Python language, with libraries from numpy, scipy and matplotlib as tools to master the field. 
## Content
* Models:
  * Transfer function models
  * Zero-Pole_Gain models
  * State-space models
* Analysis:
  * Bode-plots
  * Nyquist-plots
